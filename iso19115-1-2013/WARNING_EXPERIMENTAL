Initial commit ISO/FDIS 19115-1:2013
    
Note:
   
    - indexing, editing/viewing, CSW
    - only works in classic editor for now
    - some functions still to be checked
    - no localization for languages other than english
    - no labels for element names (this is deliberate as the aim here is to get
      this schema available in GeoNetwork for understanding of 19115-1:2013)
    - lots of editor functions have basic or no support at present
    
This is an initial commit - not working at present in 2.10.2 so don't plug it into your production instance! 2.10.3 should support it. Alternatively you can
download the ANZMEST installer (a patched version of 2.10.2 with these changes
and ISO19115-1:2013 as an install option) from:
