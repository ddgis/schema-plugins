# Schema plugin for Common Data Index (CDI).

This is the schema plugin for Common Data Index ISO19139 profil for GeoNetwork. 


"The Common Data Index (CDI) metadata format is based upon the ISO19115 content standard and both its content and XML coding have been upgraded in September 2013 to the ISO19139 schema and made INSPIRE compliant. Also the MIKADO software has been upgraded so that it can work with and produce CDI XML files that are following the upgraded CDI content and XML format. It should be noted that the content upgrading also concerns migrating to the new Vocabularies (NVS2.0) and  including a number of optional extensions. Provisions have been made in the new MIKADO to read both the previous and the new CDI XML files and to export both in the new XML format, ensuring upwards compatibility."
